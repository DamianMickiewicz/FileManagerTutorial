#  Challenge!

1. Use interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its size to something larger.

2. In your main table view, show the image names in sorded order, so "nssl0033.jpg" comes before "nssl0034.jpg". 

3. Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show "Picture X of Y", where Y is the total number of images and X is the picture's position in the array.
